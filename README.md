# Jenkins Ansible Playbook for PHP Projects

This is an ansible playbook that provisions an Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy salamander) server with Jenkins ready to build PHP projects. 

It follows [Sebastian Bergmann's](http://sebastian-bergmann.de) [Template for Jenkins Jobs for PHP Projects](http://jenkins-php.org/)

You will need to add the [Apache Ant Build](http://jenkins-php.org/download/build.xml) file to your project.


## Vagrant
