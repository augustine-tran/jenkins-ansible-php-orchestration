# Jenkins PHP Ansible

This is an ansible playbook that provisions an Ubuntu 12.04 (precise32) server with Jenkins ready to build PHP projects. 

It follows [Sebastian Bergmann's](http://sebastian-bergmann.de) [Template for Jenkins Jobs for PHP Projects](http://jenkins-php.org/)

You will need to add the [Apache Ant Build](http://jenkins-php.org/download/build.xml) file to your project.

You can test this by running `vagrant up` or setting your host in the `inventory\production` file.
